## Quick Summary

The main requirements of the project were completed with Claude Code assistance. This includes code analysis, bug fixes, testing, 
optimizations, and documentation. The assignment requirements (business logic fixes) were fully implemented, plus 
additional improvements for production readiness.

The choice to use Claude Code for the assignment was mainly for efficiency in writing code and helping to maintain the
focus on the business logic and structure of the solutions. A description of the workflow is provided in the SUMMARY.md file.
