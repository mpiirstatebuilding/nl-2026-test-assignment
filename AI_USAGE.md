# AI Usage Documentation

**Project**: Nortal LEAP 2026 Library Management System
**AI Tool**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic) via Claude Code interface

## Quick Summary

The main requirements of the project were completed with Claude Code assistance. This includes code analysis, bug fixes, testing, 
optimizations, and documentation. The assignment requirements (business logic fixes) were fully implemented, plus 
additional improvements for production readiness.

The choice to use Claude Code for the assignment was mainly for efficiency in writing code and helping to maintain the
focus on the business logic and structure of the solutions. Further details are provided in the [SUMMARY.md](SUMMARY.md).

# Workflow
The workflow for this project mainly consisted of an iterative process where:
1. I identified what needed to be done and created a task list,
2. I gave the list to Claude Code and directed it to create an implementation plan,
3. I verified the implementation plan, asked Claude to modify it as needed, and once satisfied, directed it to begin implementation,
4. I tested the application and noted down any bugs that needed fixing, or other improvements.

Occasionally, I would also ask Claude to review the code and find potential areas for improvement that I hadn't caught.

I had a similar workflow for the phase of coding without AI assistance, writing a to-do list of tasks and implementing
them one by one, making changes to the list as needed.
